# Experimental Portfolio
## Description

This is a personal project undertaken to test and practice intermediate concepts in HTML5 and CSS3. 

## Major Takeaways
### Continuous evaluation of design choices
This Project provided me the opportunity to reconsider the font styles, positioning of elements, and color choices quite frequently. Choosing appropriate color combination for the background of different sections, button, footer, and text was the most time-consuming task, since I needed to ensure the colors blended well and/or complemented each other.

### Understanding some CSS features
The following CSS properties were what I learned as I worked on the project.

- CSS animations
- CSS variables
- CSS pseudo class selectors
- CSS transform property
